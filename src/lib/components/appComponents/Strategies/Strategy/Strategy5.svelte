  This strategy involves using multiple and varied examples to enhance students'
  understanding of complex concepts, drawing on research suggesting that such an
  approach aids in decontextualizing ideas, improving recall, and facilitating
  the transfer of learning (Kirschner & Heal, 2022; Perkins & Salomon, 1992). By
  presenting diverse examples, students are better able to grasp the underlying
  principles of a concept and apply these insights to new situations. This
  method offers several benefits: it provides a real-world context that makes
  abstract concepts more tangible, uses stories or analogies as memorable
  anchors, and encourages critical thinking by having students analyze different
  examples. Furthermore, the varied examples expose the complexity and nuances
  of concepts, enhancing students' ability to abstract general principles.

  However, there are potential pitfalls. Crafting effective examples can be
  time-consuming and demanding, posing a significant challenge for educators
  with already full schedules. Teachers must consider the engagement and
  relevance of the examples to ensure they resonate with students, as well as
  strike a balance between sufficient detail and clarity to avoid overwhelming
  or under-challenging students. Thus, while the strategy of using varied
  examples has strong pedagogical benefits, its implementation requires careful
  planning and consideration to maximize effectiveness and manageability.

  Language models like ChatGPT can significantly assist teachers in employing
  the strategy of using multiple and varied examples to teach complex concepts,
  enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of their instruction. Here are
  several ways how AI can be leveraged:
